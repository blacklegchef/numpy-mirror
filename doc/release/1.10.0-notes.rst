NumPy 1.10.0 Release Notes
**************************

This release supports Python 2.6 - 2.7 and 3.2 - 3.4.


Highlights
==========


Dropped Support
===============
* The polytemplate.py file has been removed.
* The _dotblas module is no longer available.
* The testcalcs.py file has been removed.


Future Changes
==============


Compatibility notes
===================
NPY_RELAXED_STRIDE_CHECKING is now true by default.


New Features
============

`np.cbrt` to compute cube root for real floats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`np.cbrt` wraps the C99 cube root function `cbrt`.
Compared to `np.power(x, 1./3.)` it is well defined for negative real floats
and a bit faster.


Improvements
============


Changes
=======

dotblas functionality moved to multiarray
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The cblas versions of dot, inner, and vdot have been integrated into
the multiarray module. In particular, vdot is now a multiarray function,
which it was not before.

stricter check of gufunc signature compliance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Inputs to generalized universal functions are now more strictly checked
against the function's signature: all core dimensions are now required to
be present in input arrays; core dimensions with the same label must have
the exact same size; and output core dimension's must be specified, either
by a same label input core dimension or by a passed-in output array.


Deprecations
============

alterdot, restoredot Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The alterdot and restoredot functions no longer do anything, and are
deprecated.
