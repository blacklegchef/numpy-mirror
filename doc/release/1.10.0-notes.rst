NumPy 1.10.0 Release Notes
**************************

This release supports Python 2.6 - 2.7 and 3.2 - 3.4.


Highlights
==========


Dropped Support
===============
* The polytemplate.py file has been removed.
* The _dotblas module is no longer available.
* The testcalcs.py file has been removed.


Future Changes
==============


Compatibility notes
===================
NPY_RELAXED_STRIDE_CHECKING is now true by default.


New Features
============

`np.cbrt` to compute cube root for real floats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`np.cbrt` wraps the C99 cube root function `cbrt`.
Compared to `np.power(x, 1./3.)` it is well defined for negative real floats
and a bit faster.


Improvements
============

`np.poly` now casts integer inputs to float
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`np.poly` will now cast 1-dimensional input arrays of integer type to double
precision floating point, to prevent integer overflow when computing the monic
polynomial. It is still possible to obtain higher precision results by
passing in an array of object type, filled e.g. with Python ints.


Changes
=======

dotblas functionality moved to multiarray
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The cblas versions of dot, inner, and vdot have been integrated into
the multiarray module. In particular, vdot is now a multiarray function,
which it was not before.


Deprecations
============

alterdot, restoredot Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The alterdot and restoredot functions no longer do anything, and are
deprecated.
