NumPy 1.10.0 Release Notes
**************************

This release supports Python 2.6 - 2.7 and 3.2 - 3.4.


Highlights
==========


Dropped Support
===============
* The polytemplate.py file has been removed.
* The _dotblas module is no longer available.
* The testcalcs.py file has been removed.


Future Changes
==============
* The SafeEval class will be removed.
* The alterdot and restoredot functions will be removed.


Compatibility notes
===================
NPY_RELAXED_STRIDE_CHECKING is now true by default.


New Features
============

`np.cbrt` to compute cube root for real floats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`np.cbrt` wraps the C99 cube root function `cbrt`.
Compared to `np.power(x, 1./3.)` it is well defined for negative real floats
and a bit faster.


Improvements
============

`np.digitize` using binary search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`np.digitize` is now implemented in terms of `np.searchsorted`. This means
that a binary search is used to bin the values, which scales much better
for larger number of bins than the previous linear search. It also removes
the requirement for the input array to be 1-dimensional.

`np.poly` now casts integer inputs to float
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`np.poly` will now cast 1-dimensional input arrays of integer type to double
precision floating point, to prevent integer overflow when computing the monic
polynomial. It is still possible to obtain higher precision results by
passing in an array of object type, filled e.g. with Python ints.

`np.interp` can now be used with periodic functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`np.interp` now has a new parameter `period` that supplies the period of the
input data `xp`. In such case, the input data is properly normalized to the
given period and one end point is added to each extremity of `xp` in order to
close the previous and the next period cycles, resulting in the correct
interpolation behavior.


Changes
=======

dotblas functionality moved to multiarray
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The cblas versions of dot, inner, and vdot have been integrated into
the multiarray module. In particular, vdot is now a multiarray function,
which it was not before.


Deprecations
============

SafeEval
~~~~~~~~
The SafeEval class in numpy/lib/utils.py is deprecated and will be removed
in the next release.

alterdot, restoredot Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The alterdot and restoredot functions no longer do anything, and are
deprecated.
