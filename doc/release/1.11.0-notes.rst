Compatibility notes
===================


New Features
============

* `np.histogram` now provides plugin estimators for automatically estimating the optimal
number of bins. Passing one of ['auto', 'fd', 'scott', 'rice', 'sturges']
as the argument to 'bins' results in the corresponding estimator being used.

* A benchmark suite using `Airspeed Velocity <http://spacetelescope.github.io/asv/>`__
has been added, converting the previous vbench-based one. You can run the suite locally
via ``python runtests.py --bench``. For more details, see ``benchmarks/README.rst``.

* A new function ``np.shares_memory`` that can check exactly whether two
arrays have memory overlap is added. ``np.may_share_memory`` also now
has an option to spend more effort to reduce false positives.

Improvements
============

*np.gradient* now supports an ``axis`` argument
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``axis`` parameter was added to *np.gradient* for consistency.
It allows to specify over which axes the gradient is calculated.
