==========================
NumPy 1.13.0 Release Notes
==========================

This release supports Python 2.7 and 3.4 - 3.6.

Highlights
==========


Dropped Support
===============


Deprecations
============


Build System Changes
====================


Future Changes
==============


Compatibility notes
===================

DeprecationWarning to error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FutureWarning to changed behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``numpy.average`` now preserves subclasses, matching the behavior of most
  other numpy functions such as ``mean``.  As a consequence, also calls that
  returned a scalar may now return a subclass array scalar.


C API
~~~~~


New Features
============

``axes`` argument for ``unique``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In an N-dimensional array, the user can now choose the axis along which to look
for duplicate N-1-dimensional elements using ``numpy.unique``. The original
behaviour is recovered if ``axis=None`` (default).


Improvements
============


Changes
=======

``average`` now preserves subclasses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For ndarray subclasses, ``numpy.average`` will now return an instance of the
subclass, matching the behavior of most other numpy functions such as ``mean``.
As a consequence, also calls that returned a scalar may now return a subclass
array scalar.
