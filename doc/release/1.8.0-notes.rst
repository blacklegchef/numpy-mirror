2.4 and 2.5 has been dropped.



Highlights
==========


Compatibility notes
===================

numpy.diag, np.diagonal, and the diagonal method of ndarrays return a view
onto the original array, instead of producing a copy.

selecting multiple fields out of an array also produces a view.

The hash function of numpy.void scalars has been changed.  Previously the
pointer to the data was hashed as an integer.  Now, the hash function uses
the tuple-hash algorithm to combine the hash functions of the elements of
the scalar, but only if the scalar is read-only.
