=========================
NumPy 1.8.0 Release Notes
=========================

This release supports  Python 2.6 -2.7 and 3.1 - 3.3.


Highlights
==========

Dropped Support
===============

Support for Python versions 2.4 and 2.5 has been dropped,

Support for SCons has been removed.


Compatibility notes
===================

numpy.diag, np.diagonal, and the diagonal method of ndarrays return a view
onto the original array, instead of producing a copy.

selecting multiple fields out of an array also produces a view.

The hash function of numpy.void scalars has been changed.  Previously the
pointer to the data was hashed as an integer.  Now, the hash function uses
the tuple-hash algorithm to combine the hash functions of the elements of
the scalar, but only if the scalar is read-only.

New features
============

Euler's constant is now exposed in numpy as euler_gamma.
