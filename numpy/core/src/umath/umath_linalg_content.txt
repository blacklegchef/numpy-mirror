			 umath_linalg module

This module provides gufuncs for several functions that were already present in
numpy.linalg. There are some extra functions thrown in.

Having them as gufuncs allows broadcasting of calls, which can be useful when 
there are various problems to solve.

The functions are members of a module currently at numpy.core.umath_linalg

		    Note on uniform parameters
There are some configuration parameters in some of the functions in the linalg
module that configure how some computation is to be done. Examples are eigh and
eigvalsh, that take an optional keywork parameter that allows to specify 
whether to use the upper or the lower triangular part (UPLO). That parameter is
considered uniform for all broadcast operations. As in the gufunc interface
there is no way to specify uniform parameters, it has been encoded in the gufunc
name, so for eigh we have the functions eigh_lo and eigh_up (for 'L' and 'U').

Similar techniques have been applied in other places.

			     Note on svd
svd uses uniform parameters to specify the result types it will be producing
(full_matrices and compute_uv in numpy.linalg).
svd is also special in the sense that the signature of the function depends on
the size of the parameters, as for a matrix m by n, the result is a vector with
min(m,n) values. This is not supported by the gufunc harness, so specialized
versions of the gufunc are provided that encode whether m<n or m>n, so they
can specify the signature accordingly. This is also encoded in the gufunc name.

The function to use, in pseudocode, would be:

func = 'svd'
if (m < n):
   func += '_m'
else:
   func += '_n'

if compute_uv:
   if full_matrices:
      func += '_f'
   else:
      func += '_s'

		     Bug in numpy gufunc harness
The bug in the gufunc harness that was preventing using a dimension name more than
once in a single operand has been fixed. This bug was preventing some versions of
svd to be functional. It also meant that some other gufuncs that required square
matrices where implemented with signatures that did not enforce the matrices to be
square, resulting in undefined behavior if the kernel was applied in non-square
kernels.

The signatures of gufuncs that expect square matrices have been updated so that the
harness enforces the squareness of the arguments.
